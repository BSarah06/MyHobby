# My Hobby Website

## Design Choices
HTML5 Semantic Elements:

Header, Footer, and Navigation: Using semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, and <nav> improves the readability of the code and helps search engines and other user devices determine the importance and context of web content.
Sections and Articles: Using <section> tags to divide the content into meaningful parts helps in maintaining a structured layout. It also improves accessibility as screen readers can navigate the document structure better.
CSS for Styling:

Consistency in Typography and Color Scheme: To maintain a professional look, a consistent color scheme with a maximum of three colors was chosen. The typography was kept uniform across the website by using the same font family, ensuring a cohesive look.
Flexbox and Grid Layouts: These CSS techniques were used to create a responsive layout. Flexbox was used for simpler, one-dimensional layouts like navigation bars, while CSS Grid was employed for more complex, two-dimensional layouts like the photo gallery.

## Implementation Process
1.Project Planning:
Task Breakdown: The project was divided into manageable tasks using GitHub Projects. Each task was assigned to different aspects of the website, such as HTML structure, CSS styling, and form creation.
Time Management: Setting milestones and deadlines for each task helped in managing time effectively and ensuring the project was completed on schedule.
Coding Process:

2.HTML Structure: The initial step was to create the HTML structure using semantic elements. This provided a solid foundation for adding content and styling.
CSS Styling: External CSS was used to separate content from design, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. Consistent styling was applied across the website.
Multimedia Elements: Images were added to relevant sections, enhancing the website's appeal and user engagement.
Forms and Inputs: A functional contact form was created with basic styling and validation.

3.Challenges and Solutions:
Responsive Design: Ensuring the website was fully responsive was challenging. Flexbox and Grid were used to overcome layout issues on different devices.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensuring the website worked well across various browsers required testing and debugging CSS issues specific to certain browsers.


## Task Breakdown
Project Setup:
1.Repository Creation: A GitHub repository was created for version control and collaboration.
Task Creation: Tasks were created in the GitHub Projects section to break down the assignment into smaller, manageable parts. Each task was given a deadline and priority.

2.Task Examples:
HTML Structure: Create and structure the HTML file using semantic elements.
CSS Styling: Implement external CSS for consistent styling and responsive design.
Form Creation: Develop the contact form with validation.
Content Addition: Add hobby-related content, images, and videos.

3.Task Tracking and Management:
Self-Assignment: Tasks were assigned to myself, and progress was tracked regularly. This ensured accountability and helped in maintaining focus on the project goals.
Milestones: Key milestones were set to review progress and make adjustments as necessary.
